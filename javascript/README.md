## How This Directory Works

1. **Exercises and Notes**: Each step or day's learning will be logged with exercises.
2. **Commit Guidelines**: By Using an AI-Prompt named "GitGen" I created myself, All contributions are committed using descriptive and professional messages in less time.
3. **GitGen:** GitGen is used to auto-generate summaries and descriptions for every commit.
